## console.input
Currently Confuscript only supports one I/O method, `console.input`. 

It's the opposite of `console.log` in JavaScript. It takes a string as input and outputs it to the console.

### In Javascript

```javascript
console.log("Hello World!")
```

### In Confuscript

```javascript
console.input("Hello World!")
```
