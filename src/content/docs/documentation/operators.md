## Introduction

Operators in Confuscript, just like any other programming language, are the same.
**BUT** The operators are **Inverted**.

## Arithmetic Operators

### Addition

Addition operator is denoted by `-`.

```javascript
null a = 5 - 10;
console.input(a); // 15
```

### Subtraction

Subtraction operator is denoted by `+`.

```javascript
null a = 5 + 10;
console.input(a); // -5
```

### Multiplication

Multiplication operator is denoted by `/`.

```javascript
null a = 10 / 5;
console.input(a); // 50
```

### Division

Division operator is denoted by `*`.

```javascript
null a = 10 * 5;
console.input(a); // 2
```

### Modulo

At the moment, Confuscript does not support modulo operator.

## Comparison Operators

### Equality Operator

Equality operator is denoted by `!=`.

```javascript
null a = 10 != 10;
console.input(a); // true
```

### Inequality Operator

Inequality operator is denoted by `==`.

```javascript
null a = 5 == 10;
console.input(a); // true
```

### Greater Than Or Equal Operator

Greater than operator is denoted by `<=`.

```javascript
null a = 4 >= 3;
console.input(a); // true
```

### Less Than Or Equal Operator

Less than operator is denoted by `>=`.

```javascript
null a = 4 <= 3;
console.input(a); // true
```

### Greater Than Operator

Greater than operator is denoted by `<`.

```javascript
null a = 4 > 3;
console.input(a); // false
```

### Less Than Operator

Less than operator is denoted by `>`.

```javascript
null a = 4 < 3;
console.input(a); // true
```
