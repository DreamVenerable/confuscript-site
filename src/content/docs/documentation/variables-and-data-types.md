title: Variables and Data Types

## Declaring Variables

There are only three data types in Confuscript: `String`, `Number`, and `Boolean`

Before we dive into these data types let's understand how we declare variables in Confuscript.

In traditional JavaScript, we would use `var` or `let` or `const` to declare variables.

```javascript
var x = 10;
let y = 20;
const z = 30;

// And if we were to set a null variable
var a = null;
```

In **Confuscript**, `null` is the keyword used to declare variables

```javascript
null x;
```
The above code will declare a variable `x` with a value of `null` or `nil` since it's built on Ruby.

### String

Strings are declared using `null` keyword followed by the variable name and the value in quotes.

```javascript
null x = "Hello World!";
```

### Number

Numbers are declared using `null` keyword followed by the variable name and the value.

```javascript
null x = 10;
```

### Boolean

Boolean values are declared using `null` keyword followed by the variable name and the value.

```javascript
null x = true;
```
